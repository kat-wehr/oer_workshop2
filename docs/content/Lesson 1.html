<h2>Opportunities To Get Involved
</h2>
<p>Getting involved is going to be one of the key factors in your success here at Penn State and specifically as a Smeal student. Whenever you start something new in life, surrounding yourself with a community of like-minded, supportive individuals is always a great idea. Whenever I move to a new city or take on a new job, creating a community is one of the first things I always do.
</p>
<p>Although the beginning of a college semester is typically a busy time for students, it's important to make time to go to the involvement fair. It's always easiest to join a new group when everyone is new, and you can then factor in club and organization activities into your time management plan right from the start. 
</p>
<h2 class=" hax-active ">Involvement Fair
</h2>
<p>The Involvement Fair takes place at the HUB, and student-run organizations that span all majors, minors, and special interest groups come together to recruit new members at the start of every semester. The largest Involvement Fair is in the beginning of the semester, and generally takes place the first week of classes.
</p>
<p>This semester's Involvement Fair takes place January 9-10 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Alumni Hall at the HUB. Learn more about the Involvement Fair by watching the video.</p>

<h2>Serving Your Community
</h2>
<video-player resource="#3bd38f3d-dfd6-a951-a2e6" prefix="oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org " responsive class=" video-player-0  video-player-0" source="https://vimeo.com/169582457" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/169582457?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&color=FF031D" sandboxed width="560" height="315" caption="Community Service from a Business Standpoint" text-color="#000000" text-color-class="black-text" yt-nocookie yt-controls video-color="FF031D"></video-player>
<p>Once you've built a strong community around you, the flip side is service to your community. Community service is becoming an increasingly prevalent part of the business world, as you will discover in the next video. Not only is community service important for diversifying the experiences on your resume, but also because serving one's community helps bring diverse populations together, raises awareness, and makes communities stronger overall.
</p>
<p>After you have watched the video, please answer the following question.
